# Hashes in ruby are same as dictionary in python
# Hashes are data structure containing key-value pairs

# Keys are unique, Values can be same for multiple keys
# Hash values are extracted using keys and not by the order

# Hashes are represented by {}
# Example of printing a hash {key => value, key => value, key => value}

hash = {}

hash["a"] = "apple"
hash["b"] = "ball"
hash["c"] = "cat"

p hash
puts hash
puts hash.class
